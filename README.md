# CS300-MOD8
In this course projects, we tackled the challenge of building a system to manage course information for academic advising. The goal was to create a tool that could list courses, display their details, and handle prerequisites effectively.

Approaching this problem required a deep dive into understanding the requirements and devising an efficient way to store and manipulate course data. I learned that data structures play a critical role here. They dictate how smoothly our program can perform tasks like searching for courses or accessing their details.

Throughout the project, I encountered roadblocks, but I overcame them by consulting course materials, seeking help from instructors and peers, and breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable chunks.

Working on this project broadened my perspective on software design. I gained hands-on experience in implementing various data structures like vectors, hash tables, and trees, and learned to choose the right one for each task.

Moreover, this project improved my programming skills significantly. I learned to write code that's not only functional but also maintainable, readable, and adaptable. By following best practices and considering real-world scenarios, I became more confident in my ability to create high-quality software.
